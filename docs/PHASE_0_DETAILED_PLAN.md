# Phase 0 – Finalize Specs - Simplified Plan

## Overview
**Duration**: 0.5 day  
**Owner**: Tech Lead AI  
**Goal**: Dọn tài liệu và confirm với backend trước khi bắt đầu development

---

## Task 1: Clean UTF-8 encoding (0.2 day)

### Actions:
- [ ] Scan `docs/AI_SUGGESTIONS_REQUIREMENTS.md` for encoding issues
- [ ] Scan `docs/AI_SUGGESTIONS_WIREFRAMES.md` for encoding issues
- [ ] Replace "E" characters with proper spaces
- [ ] Fix "hềEtrợ" → "hỗ trợ" and similar issues
- [ ] Standardize emoji usage (🤖, 📅, ⏱️, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure consistent UTF-8 encoding

### Common encoding patterns to fix:
- `E` → ` ` (space)
- `hềEtrợ` → `hỗ trợ`
- `E` → ` ` (bullet points)
- `⏱E` → `⏱️` (emoji)
- `📅E` → `📅` (emoji)
- `🤖E` → `🤖` (emoji)

### Deliverable:
- Clean, properly encoded specification documents
- Note encoding fixes in handoff summary

---

## Task 2: Sync terminology (0.2 day)

### Quick verification checklist:
- [ ] `suggested_slots` (not `items`) ✓
- [ ] `slot_index` (not `item_index`) ✓
- [ ] `planned_minutes` (not `estimated_minutes`) ✓
- [ ] `selected_slot_index` ✓
- [ ] `schedule_entry_id` ✓
- [ ] `fallback_auto_mode` ✓

### Actions:
- [ ] Quick scan for any remaining inconsistencies
- [ ] Update any missed terminology in examples
- [ ] Ensure API schema naming is consistent

### Deliverable:
- Terminology synchronized across all documents
- Note any changes in handoff summary

---

## Task 3: Backend confirmation (0.1 day)

### Actions:
- [ ] Circulate cleaned specs to backend team
- [ ] Confirm API schema acceptance
- [ ] Get final sign-off on requirements
- [ ] Address any last-minute clarifications

### Deliverable:
- Backend confirmation and sign-off
- Any final specification updates

---

## Deliverables Summary

### Documents (cleaned):
1. `docs/AI_SUGGESTIONS_REQUIREMENTS.md` (UTF-8 cleaned)
2. `docs/AI_SUGGESTIONS_WIREFRAMES.md` (UTF-8 cleaned)

### New documents:
1. `docs/PHASE_0_HANDOFF.md` (summary for Phase 1)

### Notes:
- Encoding fixes documented in handoff
- Terminology changes noted in handoff
- Backend confirmation status recorded
- Implementation requirements extracted from specs

---

## Quality Checklist

### Phase 0 completion criteria:
- [ ] All encoding issues resolved
- [ ] Terminology consistent across documents
- [ ] Backend team confirmed specifications
- [ ] Handoff document ready for Phase 1
- [ ] No blockers for development start
- [ ] Handoff doc được cập nhật với change log (encoding + thuật ngữ + phản hồi backend)

---

## Handoff to Phase 1

### What's ready:
- ✅ Clean specification documents
- ✅ Synchronized terminology
- ✅ Backend-confirmed API schema
- ✅ Implementation requirements extracted

### What Phase 1 will handle:
- 🏗️ Component structure creation
- 📝 TypeScript interfaces setup
- ⚙️ Configuration files
- 🚀 Actual development work

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 0 is complete when:
- [ ] Documents are clean and properly encoded
- [ ] Terminology is consistent
- [ ] Backend has confirmed specifications
- [ ] Phase 1 can start without blockers
- [ ] Handoff document is ready with change log
